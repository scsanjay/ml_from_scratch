# Implementation of Machine Learning Models or Simple ML related tools
Here I will implement various ML models from scratch as part of learning process. So don't expect it to be perfect. And please let me know if you find any issue.

I will implement the basic version of the models and might ignore some boundry cases because those are not as important as implementing the core model.
